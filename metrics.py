"""Metrics for pyramid vs LIME vs regional-IG, against the xai_suff harness.

THREE THINGS, AT TWO ORDERS
---------------------------
FIRST-ORDER faithfulness (insertion/deletion via regional_eval): fair on a
  shared cell grid, and BECAUSE it is fair, LIME is a strong baseline. Pyramid's
  additive map (sum_leaf_v, ~1% leftover) ties or loses here. Report honestly.
  Use del_fill="mean" (non-circular) for the headline number; del_fill="blur"
  shares pyramid's Phi and a win there is partly circular (the harness docstring
  says so). Insertion/deletion is FIRST-ORDER: it sums marginal region effects
  and has no slot for "A and B only matter together", so it cannot reward an
  interaction method for finding interaction. Do not rank by the Delta map here.

SECOND-ORDER interaction (NAI + pairwise matrix + Delta-faithfulness): the
  quantity a linear surrogate sets to zero. LIME predicts a region as the sum of
  its leaf weights -- implied interaction = identity, zero off-diagonal -- so it
  CANNOT represent cooperation regardless of fit. Pyramid measures it directly.
  This is the defensible distinction: not "pyramid beats LIME at LIME's job",
  but "pyramid measures an order LIME's model class omits".

DELTA-FAITHFULNESS (delta_faithfulness): the right way to use Delta. Not by
  stuffing the Delta map into first-order insertion/deletion (wrong quantity,
  and circular through Phi), but by a COALITION-REVEAL test: for node R, compare
  the additive prediction sum_c v(c) against the interaction prediction v(R), and
  validate against a direct forward pass on R's region. If the model's true joint
  reveal matches v(R) and not sum_c v(c), the synergy is faithful. The additive
  model's error is exactly |Delta(R)| -- the gap LIME is stuck with.
